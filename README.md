# ðŸ“Œ Travel Project
This project was built using Asp.Net MVC5. I used MSSQL database.

## âœ¨ The Project Objective
Adding the places you have visited, expressing your opinions about these areas, and guiding future travelers were the main goals of the project. By personalizing the project, you can define your route, share the places you have visited along this route, and convey your own perspectives by commenting on areas in that region.
